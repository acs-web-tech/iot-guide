# MQTT Broker Library for Node.js

## Overview

Our open-source **MQTT Broker Library** is a high-performance, scalable, and fully-compliant broker implementation in Node.js. It supports **MQTT 3.1, MQTT 3.1.1, and MQTT 5.0** with WebSocket and **HTTP/3** capabilities, ensuring seamless communication for IoT and industrial applications.

This library is designed for extensibility, security, and efficiency, catering to developers and enterprises looking for a robust MQTT solution.

## Features

- **Full Support for MQTT 3.1 & MQTT 5.0** (IBM MQTT V3.1 and OASIS MQTT 5 Specifications)
- **WebSocket & HTTP/3 Support** for modern real-time applications
- **Efficient Message Routing & Retained Messages**
- **QoS (Quality of Service) Levels 0, 1, and 2**
- **Authentication & Authorization Mechanisms** (Pluggable security layers)
- **Bridging Support (Upcoming)**: SCADA-to-MQTT bridging for industrial applications
- **Graphics & Visualization Library (Upcoming)**
- **Extensible Plugin System** for custom integrations
- **Optimized for Performance** with minimal memory footprint
- **Zero Dependency on External MQTT Brokers**
- **Open-Source & Community-Driven**


## Protocol Compliance

This library strictly adheres to:
- **IBM MQTT V3.1 Specification**
- **OASIS MQTT 5.0 Specification**

We ensure full interoperability with MQTT-compliant clients and brokers.

## Roadmap

- **SCADA to MQTT Bridging** (for industrial IoT applications)
- **Advanced Security Features** (TLS , OAuth 2.0, JWT Authentication)
- **Cluster Support & High Availability**
- **Custom Visualization & Dashboarding (Graphics Library)**
- **Rule Engine for Automated Message Processing**

## Current Development Status
We are currently working on the initial implementation of MQTT 3.1.1 as per the IBM specification and expect a First Stage Beta Release on March 16,2025.
