## Execution Instruction 

After clonning the repo just switch your directory to **iot-guide** now run

```
npm install
```
```
npm run watch
```
Now switch to **main** folder and execute the following command
```
node server.js
```
Also run **client.js** from **iot-client-test-scripts** folder now you can see the output

worried of using repeated node commands,We will be switching to nodemon soon!
